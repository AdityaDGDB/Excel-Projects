## Insight

1. Net accident was lower in 2022 compared to 2023:
In the year 2022, the total number of recorded accidents was lower than in 2023. This could be due to various factors such as changes in traffic regulations, increased awareness campaigns, or improvements in road safety measures.

2. Accident by car has the highest casualties:
Among all types of vehicles involved in accidents, those categorized as "car" resulted in the highest number of casualties. This suggests that car accidents may lead to more severe outcomes in terms of injuries or fatalities compared to accidents involving other types of vehicles.

4. Dry and carriage has the most number of accidents:
The specific condition "dry and carriage" is associated with the highest number of recorded accidents. This condition might refer to dry road conditions with the presence of a carriage or cargo. Possible reasons for this could include high traffic volumes, specific road configurations, or frequent use of roads for transportation.

5. In urban region most number of accidents are observed:
The urban region consistently experiences the highest number of accidents. This could be attributed to factors such as higher population density, increased traffic congestion, complex road networks, and a greater likelihood of interactions between vehicles and pedestrians in urban areas.

6. Though dark road is prone to accidents but most of the accidents are observed in daylight:
Even though dark road conditions are generally considered more prone to accidents, the data reveals that the majority of accidents occur during daylight hours.
